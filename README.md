# Music-Parsers
A bunch of programms that revolve around. Getting Tags for music-files and rewriting those

Mostly for my own personal use as I chose to automate some of it instead of spending an hour or so to do this manually.
Majority (except Music-Parser.py) will probably never be used again, but I like the thought of having the code archived (sort of)
